# Modules

This is where all non-necessary modules are stored. These are modules that are not required for Lilypad to function, but are still useful to have.

Modules here are registered through reflection, and are not hardcoded in other places in Lilypad.

It is structured like this so more modules can be dragged and dropped in, without any other configuration
